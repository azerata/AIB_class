To implement the algorithm efficient we must be able to get the one from the other in constant time. Explain how to make two arrays, ORIG and DF, each of size n, such that ORIG[i] is the original name of the node with DF name i, and similarly, DF[i] is the DF name of the node with original name i. (Since Day's algorithm should run in time O(n), you should be able to construct these arrays in time O(n))."
