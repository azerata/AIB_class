    "An often used distance measure between trees with edge lengths is the sum of the square of differences in edge lengths for equivalent splits/edges between two trees, with the edge length for a missing split taken to be 0.0. How fast can you compute this distance between two unrooted trees? (This distance measure is also referred to as the Branch Score Distance introduced by Kuhnerand Felsenstein in 2004, see the TreeDist www-page for an example/explanation.)"

Explain why what is done in Saitou and Nei's algorithm is the same as in the generic algorithm when the unknown true tree is additive."
