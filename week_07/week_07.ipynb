    "In the Four-Russian algorithm for computing unit-cost edit distance, the parameter t specifies the size of the blocks that are precomputed. On slide 42 in the slides from the lecture, we compute that we cf. the theory should pick t = 2 for n < 20736, i.e. all inputs in practice. How would you implement the block-function in this case (we assume that the alphabet size is 4)? (Think about how many bits you need to encode the input (B', C', x, and y) and the output (F').) How would it change if we pick t=3?"

    "One might say that the Four-Russian algorithm makes little sense if we pick t=1. However, this is of course possible. How would you implement the block-function for t=1? Recall that the slides from the lecture actually shows that the Four-Russian algorithm with t=1 is faster than a direct implementation of unit-cost edit distance using dynamic programming. Why do you think that this is the case?"
